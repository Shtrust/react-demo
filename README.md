# react-demo

A demo to learn the basics of React

## Instructions

-   <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository" target="_blank">Fork</a> this repository
-   Using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> (or any other Git tool), pull your forked repository locally
-   Open the local repository in the IDE of your choice, I recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>
-   Make sure you have <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html" target="_blank">Prettier</a> installed on your IDE
-   Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> (which should install npm as well) and insure the `npm` command works in the terminal
-   Run `npm install`, then `npm start` to run in development in your IDE
-   Follow the prompt given below. This exercise is quite autodidactic.

## Prompt

You are given a barebones React project, a mockup and a technical sheet.

Your job is to:

1. Recreate the mockup as authentically as possible (should be identical)
    - Try to use flexbox in your CSS as much as possible
    - Avoid absolute positioning or use of margin for positioning
    - Use components! Create at least a component for the buttons
2. Implement the stopwatch functionality (Advanced)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.
